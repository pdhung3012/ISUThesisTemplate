\chapter{FUTURE WORK SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION}
\label{future-work}


This is the opening paragraph to my thesis which
explains in general terms the concepts and hypothesis
which will be used in my thesis.

With more general information given here than really
necessary.

\section{SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION}

Here initial concepts and conditions are explained and
several hypothesis are mentioned in brief.


\subsection{Hypothesis}

Here one particular hypothesis is explained in depth
and is examined in the light of current literature.

As can be seen in Table~\ref{nothingelse} it is
truly obvious what I am saying is true.
